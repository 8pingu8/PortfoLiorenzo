# Portfolio Website Roadmap

## 1. Project Setup
- Fork/clone the Kent C. Dodds personal website template (Remix-based).
- Set up local development environment.
- Set up Vercel deployment with GitHub integration.

## 2. Content Structure
- Define and document the YAML/MDX structure for projects and bio.
- Add example content for both projects and bio.

## 3. 3D Animation Integration
- Integrate a 3D library (three.js or react-three-fiber).
- Create a reusable 3D component with a simple object that tracks the mouse position (object "looks at" the cursor).
- Add this component to the layout so it appears on all pages.

## 4. Project & Bio Pages
- Implement project list and detail pages, pulling from YAML/MDX content.
- Implement bio/contact page, pulling from YAML/MDX content.

## 5. Media Embeds
- Ensure support for images, GIFs, and self-hosted MP4s in project details.

## 6. Contact Section
- Add email, LinkedIn, and Discord links to the contact/bio page.

## 7. Polish & Documentation
- Ensure the codebase is clean and easy to update.
- Write a clear README and inline docs for content updates.

## 8. Optional: Theming/Styling
- Add subtle animation/theming tweaks as needed. 

## 9. Final Step
- Restore Vanta Waves animated background as the last visual polish step.
