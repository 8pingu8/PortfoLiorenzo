    # Game Concept
    Connection Lost is a modern take on the classic pipe-connection puzzle genre, reimagined in 3D with a unique twist. As PipeBot, a legless robot abandoned in a factory, players must use the PipeLauncher5001 to shoot connection pipes onto magnetic grid walls, creating paths for electric current to flow from generators to endpoints.

    ## Key Features
    - 3D pipe placement and connection mechanics, and flow!
    - Dynamic grid generation system
    - Precise shooting mechanics with magnetic wall interactions
    - Atmospheric abandoned factory setting
    - Progressive difficulty curve with increasingly complex puzzles
    - Level design tools for designers (and players, in particular!) to create new levels
    - Replayability and scalability

    ## Technical Implementation
    As the lead developer and primary programmer, I personally implemented all core game systems:

    - ### Core Systems
      - **Grid Generation System**: Developed a procedural grid generation system that creates varied and challenging level layouts while ensuring solvability - not automated, developed as a tool for designers. It generates both the grid (room) and the pipes already placed by the designers, as well as special rules tweakings for the single level.
      - **Pipe Connection Logic**: Built a sophisticated system based on actual 3D implementation for pipe connections, current flow simulation, and magnetic wall interactions
      - **Flow Simulation**: Implemented a flow system to simulate the flow of electricity through the pipes
      - **Level Design Tools**: Created a modular level design system for efficient content creation based on JSON, with a lot of freedom for designers to create new levels. This is also available to players, ensuring replayability and scalability.

    - ### Technical Stack
      - **Engine**: Unreal Engine 5
      - **Language**: C++
      - **Key Features**: C++ and Blueprint mixed development, Procedural generation, Level Design Tools, usage of 3D vision to implement mechanics, Niagara

    ## Project Leadership
    While being the primary developer of all game systems, I worked in a team of 8 people, and many of us were experiencing project development for the first time. This situation presented unique challenges that I successfully navigated:

    - ### Team Management
      - Coordinated development and design needs across diverse skill levels and effort levels.
      - Established communication protocols
      - Managed technical debt while meeting deadlines
      - Balanced creative vision with technical constraints

    - ### Development Process
      - Researched and implemented techniques to implement game mechanics
      - Implemented version control best practices
      - Established code review processes to maintain code quality
      - Managed sprint planning and task distribution

    The project's success demonstrates both technical adaptability and leadership, resulting in a complete demo that met all deadlines while maintaining high quality standards, without reducing the creative vision of the project.

    # Game Concept
    Space Hell is an educational game project developed during STEMdays 2024, a summer camp focused on girls' empowerment in STEM fields. The game follows Aurora, a young space academy cadet who crash-lands on an alien planet during her final exam. What starts as a seemingly hostile situation evolves into a heartwarming story of friendship and growth through gameplay and dialogue.

    ## Key Features
    - Story-driven gameplay with extensive dialogue system
    - Multiple unique minigames with different mechanics
    - Character development and relationship building
    - Complete narrative arc from start to finish
    - Educational value in both story and development process

    ## Technical Implementation
    As the project lead and mentor, I (with the help of my team) guided a team of 4 girls through their first game development experience:

    - ### Core Systems
      - **Dialogue System**: Implemented a flexible dialogue system to tell Aurora's story
      - **Minigame Framework**: Created a modular system allowing different gameplay mechanics for each minigame
      - **Scene Management**: Built a robust scene transition system to tie the experience together

    - ### Technical Stack
      - **Engine**: Godot Engine
      - **Language**: GDScript
      - **Key Features**: 2D graphics, Dialogue system, Multiple gameplay mechanics, Scene management

    ## Educational Leadership
    This project was particularly special as it combined game development with educational mentorship:

    - ### Teaching Highlights
      - Introduced complete beginners to game development concepts
      - Guided students through the entire development process
      - Ensured each team member could contribute meaningfully
      - Balanced learning objectives with project completion goals

    - ### Project Management
      - Structured the 4-day development timeline effectively
      - Divided tasks based on individual interests and abilities
      - Maintained team motivation and engagement
      - Successfully delivered a complete game within the time constraint

    The project's success is measured not just in the final product, but in the educational impact and confidence built in the participating students. We achieved our goal of creating a complete game from concept to completion in just 4 days, while ensuring every team member learned and contributed to the final product.
