    # Game Concept
    Connection Lost is a modern take on the classic pipe-connection puzzle genre, reimagined in 3D with a unique twist. As PipeBot, a legless robot abandoned in a factory, players must use the PipeLauncher5001 to shoot connection pipes onto magnetic grid walls, creating paths for electric current to flow from generators to endpoints.

    ## Key Features
    - 3D pipe placement and connection mechanics, and flow!
    - Dynamic grid generation system
    - Precise shooting mechanics with magnetic wall interactions
    - Atmospheric abandoned factory setting
    - Progressive difficulty curve with increasingly complex puzzles
    - Level design tools for designers (and players, in particular!) to create new levels
    - Replayability and scalability

    ## Technical Implementation
    As the lead developer and primary programmer, I personally implemented all core game systems:

    - ### Core Systems
      - **Grid Generation System**: Developed a procedural grid generation system that creates varied and challenging level layouts while ensuring solvability - not automated, developed as a tool for designers. It generates both the grid (room) and the pipes already placed by the designers, as well as special rules tweakings for the single level.
      - **Pipe Connection Logic**: Built a sophisticated system based on actual 3D implementation for pipe connections, current flow simulation, and magnetic wall interactions
      - **Flow Simulation**: Implemented a flow system to simulate the flow of electricity through the pipes
      - **Level Design Tools**: Created a modular level design system for efficient content creation based on JSON, with a lot of freedom for designers to create new levels. This is also available to players, ensuring replayability and scalability.

    - ### Technical Stack
      - **Engine**: Unreal Engine 5
      - **Language**: C++
      - **Key Features**: C++ and Blueprint mixed development, Procedural generation, Level Design Tools, usage of 3D vision to implement mechanics, Niagara

    ## Project Leadership
    While being the primary developer of all game systems, I worked in a team of 8 people, and many of us were experiencing project development for the first time. This situation presented unique challenges that I successfully navigated:

    - ### Team Management
      - Coordinated development and design needs across diverse skill levels and effort levels.
      - Established communication protocols
      - Managed technical debt while meeting deadlines
      - Balanced creative vision with technical constraints

    - ### Development Process
      - Researched and implemented techniques to implement game mechanics
      - Implemented version control best practices
      - Established code review processes to maintain code quality
      - Managed sprint planning and task distribution

    The project's success demonstrates both technical adaptability and leadership, resulting in a complete demo that met all deadlines while maintaining high quality standards, without reducing the creative vision of the project.
